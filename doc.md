## 1. Data Strategy

### 1.1 Purpose
Define how project data will be collected, processed, stored, secured, and disposed of in compliance with business and regulatory requirements.

### 1.2 Data Classification
| Classification | Examples | Security Level |
|----------------|----------|----------------|
| Public | Marketing material, press releases | Low |
| Internal | Internal docs, test data | Medium |
| Confidential | PII, financial data, source code | High |

### 1.3 Data Lifecycle
1. **Collection:** APIs, input forms, batch uploads.  
2. **Storage:**  
   - Structured: BigQuery / Cloud SQL  
   - Unstructured: Cloud Storage (encrypted)  
3. **Processing:** Dataflow, Dataproc, AI/ML tools.  
4. **Archiving & Retention:** Retention policy based on classification.  
5. **Disposal:** Secure deletion (lifecycle rules, cryptographic erase).

### 1.4 Data Security
- Encryption at rest (GCP-managed or CMEK via Cloud KMS).  
- Encryption in transit (TLS 1.2+).  
- IAM integration for data access.

### 1.5 Backup & Recovery
- Daily incremental backups, weekly full backups.  
- Multi-region storage; quarterly DR drills.

### 1.6 Compliance
- Placeholder: Confirm client compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.).  
- Use DLP API for sensitive data scanning.

## 2. Identity and Access Management (IAM)

### 2.1 Principles
- Apply **Principle of Least Privilege**.  
- Separate human and service accounts.  
- Enforce MFA for privileged accounts.

### 2.2 IAM Roles
| Role Type | GCP Examples | Purpose |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| Viewer | `roles/viewer` | Read-only |
| Editor | `roles/editor` | Modify resources |
| Admin | `roles/owner` | Limited admin |
| Custom | `roles/customRole` | Project-specific |

### 2.3 Authentication & Authorization
- Identity Federation / SSO.  
- Strong password policies (≥12 chars, complexity rules).  

### 2.4 Audit & Monitoring
- Enable **Cloud Audit Logs** for admin, data, and system events.  
- Enable **Security Command Center** for monitoring.

### 2.5 Policy Reviews
- Quarterly IAM review; immediate removal for offboarding.

## 3. Network Security

### 3.1 Network Design
- Separate VPCs per environment.  
- Private subnets for sensitive workloads.  
- Enable VPC Service Controls.

### 3.2 Firewall Rules
| Rule | Source | Destination | Action | Notes |
|------|--------|-------------|--------|-------|
| Allow SSH (Admin) | Admin IPs | VM Instances | Allow | Restricted access |
| Deny All Else | * | * | Deny | Default posture |

### 3.3 Connectivity
- Use Cloud VPN or Dedicated Interconnect.  
- Private Google Access for API calls.

### 3.4 Threat Protection
- Use **Cloud Armor** for DDoS mitigation.  
- Run Web Security Scanner for vulnerabilities.

### 3.5 Monitoring & Incident Response
- Cloud Logging & Monitoring with alerts.  
- Maintain incident response playbook.

## 4. API Strategy, Security, and Management

### 4.1 API Data Strategy
- Apply data classification to API payloads.  
- Return only required data fields.  
- Encrypt API traffic (TLS 1.2+).  
- Monitor API usage for anomalies.

### 4.2 API IAM
- Use OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect, or JWT for authentication.  
- Do not embed API keys in public code; apply restrictions.  
- Rotate keys regularly.  
- Centralize security using API Gateway, Apigee, or Endpoints.

### 4.3 API Network Security
- Protect APIs with WAF (Cloud Armor).  
- Enforce throttling & rate limiting.  
- Validate all requests.  
- Use private networking for sensitive APIs.

### 4.4 API Management & Monitoring
- Use Apigee for full lifecycle management.  
- Enable logging and metrics collection.  
- Conduct regular API security testing.

## 5. API Management in Google Cloud – Tool Comparison

| Feature / Capability      | Apigee | API Gateway | Cloud Endpoints |
|---------------------------|--------|-------------|-----------------|
| Primary Use Case          | Enterprise-grade, full API lifecycle | Lightweight, serverless proxy | Simple proxy with basic security/monitoring |
| Best For                  | APIs as products, monetization, enterprise governance | Serverless & fast deployments | Internal/microservice APIs |
| Supported Protocols       | REST, SOAP, gRPC, GraphQL | REST, gRPC | REST, gRPC |
| Security Features         | OAuth 2.0, JWT, API key, WAF, quotas, threat detection | API key, JWT, IAM auth | API key, JWT, IAM auth |
| Traffic Management        | Advanced (quotas, caching) | Basic | Basic |
| Analytics                 | Advanced analytics | Basic | Logging & metrics |
| Developer Portal          | Yes | No | No |
| Deployment Options        | Cloud, hybrid, on-prem | Fully managed | Fully managed |
| Complexity                | High | Low–Medium | Low |
| Cost Tier                 | High | Low | Low |

## 6. GCS (Google Cloud Storage) Implementation Guidelines

### 6.1 Data Strategy in GCS
- **Storage Classes:** Use Standard, Nearline, Coldline, or Archive based on access frequency.  
- **Lifecycle Management:** Automated transitions between classes; automated deletion after retention period.  
- **Encryption:** Default Google-managed keys or CMEK via Cloud KMS.  
- **Backups:** Versioning enabled; use dual-region/multi-region replication.

### 6.2 IAM in GCS
- **Uniform Bucket-Level Access:** Enforce bucket-level rather than object-level permissions.  
- **Roles:**  
  - Read: `roles/storage.objectViewer`  
  - Write/Manage: `roles/storage.objectAdmin`  
  - Avoid broad roles like Owner unless required.  
- **Authentication:** MFA for privileged access; use short-lived credentials via Workload Identity Federation.  
- **Audit Logging:** Enable for bucket operations; integrate with Security Command Center.  
- **Periodic Reviews:** Remove stale accounts and unused permissions.

### 6.3 Network Security in GCS
- **VPC Service Controls:** Restrict bucket access to trusted networks/projects.  
- **Private Google Access:** Prevent public internet routing for VM-to-GCS communication.  
- **Firewall & Access Controls:** Restrict instance access paths to GCS.  
- **Encryption in Transit:** Enforced by TLS 1.2+.  
- **Threat Protection:** Monitor usage patterns and access logs for anomalies.

### 6.4 Recovery Objectives in GCS
- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective):** Define max downtime allowed before restoration (e.g., 4 hours).  
- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective):** Define acceptable maximum data loss window (e.g., 1 hour).  
- **Implementation:**  
  - Use bucket replication across regions.  
  - Schedule frequent snapshots/exports matching RPO goals.  
  - Test restore operations against RTO goals.
